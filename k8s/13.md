## Values in volumes
```bash
[jaffar@fedora]$ kubectl exec app-python-helm-0 -- cat /data/counter.json
{"counter": 42}
[jaffar@fedora]$ kubectl exec app-python-helm-1 -- cat /data/counter.json
{"counter": 12}
```

Each pod is equipped with its own persistent storage, which accounts for the variation in values. The stored files remain consistent through pod updates.

## Why Pod Ordering is Unnecessary
Since pods of the same category do not have interdependencies, there's no need for specific ordering. However, ordering might be required if pods have specialized functions (such as one for reading and another for writing).

## Implementation of Concurrent Operations
The podManagementPolicy was utilized to facilitate parallel operations.

## Update Methodologies
1. Rolling Update: This commonly used technique sequentially updates each pod in a set of replicas. It involves halting, eliminating, and recreating each pod one after the other. When multiple replicas are present, this method minimizes downtime and only slightly affects performance.
2. Recreate Update: In this method, all pods are updated simultaneously, leading to a temporary complete shutdown. Due to the downtime it causes, this strategy is generally less favored.
3. Canary Update: Initially, a batch of new-version pods (about 25% more) is introduced. Following successful testing with these, the older pods are updated and the extra ones are discarded. This method, more a strategic approach than an inherent Kubernetes feature, allows for early bug detection in a subset of the user base.
