# Simple Web App (Typescript version)

## Technologies used
- React.js: My favorite library for building UI.

- React Query: Great solution for client-side data fetching.

- TailwindCSS: Great CSS framework for quickly styling a website.

## Best practices

### General
- Scalable and maintainable project structure and naming conventions.
- pre-commit hooks which include linting and format-checking.
- `.prettierrc` file to ensure code-style consistency.
- Deployed version of the app to be viewed easily.
- Typescript.
- App as a submodule.

### Coding standards
- Descriptive variable names.
- Scalable folder structure.
- Separation between UI and business logic.
- Error handling.

### Testing
- Manual tests.

P.S: Again, it didn't make sense to set-up and write automated tests for an app this simple since it would would literally take longer than it took to for implementation + manual testing.

### Ensuring code quality
- Pre-commit hooks will lint the code and format-check it to avoid issues further down the line and ensures that consistent code style is maintained in a collaborative environment.  
- `.prettierrc` will ensure that all collaborators follow the same conventions for code style.
